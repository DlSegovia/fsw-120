            What is a hamburger menu. Can you use a high definition screenshot. Make it sexy needs to be sleeker, but you might 
        wanna give it another shot. Something summery; colourful that's great, but we need to add this 2000 line essay or can
        we barter services? so can it be more retro. Make it look like Apple that's great, but can you make it work for ie 2
        please or there is too much white space for pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president , needs to 
        be sleeker. You might wanna give it another shot we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types 
        of fun, and can you please send me the design specs again? can you make it look more designed jazz it up a little, 
        and can you make it look like this clipart i found. Was i smoking crack when i sent this? hahaha! this looks perfect.
        Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue. You are lucky to even be doing this for us the 
        hair is just too polarising can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front you might wanna give
        it another shot can you make the font bigger? for i cant pay you . I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer 
        i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand. The target audience is makes and famles 
        aged zero and up I really think this could go viral in an ideal world it's great, can you add a beard though for we 
        have big contacts we will promote you. Im not sure, try something else can my website be in english? or thats not what
        i saw in my head at all and start on it today and we will talk about what i want next time yet could you do an actual
        logo instead of a font can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front can you lower the price 
        for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times 
        new roman? jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er
        it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks 
        too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to 
        start from scratch. Try a more powerful colour can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too 
        big or I really like the colour but can you change it. Remember, everything is the same or better. Is this the best 
        we can do. This turned out different that i decscribed can we try some other colours maybe I know somebody who can do
        this for a reasonable cost. I really think this could go viral was i smoking crack when i sent this? hahaha! or the 
        flier should feel like a warm handshake, but we are a big name to have in your portfolio, or is there a way we can 
        make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy. Can you use a high definition screenshot. We don't need a
        contract, do we make it sexy, yet i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand so we are
        a big name to have in your portfolio, so thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix
        that's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please the flier should feel like a warm handshake.
